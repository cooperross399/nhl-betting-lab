"""Hold a Line Movement run until the round it was scheduled for.

    python scripts/wait_for_round.py --schedule "0 15 * 1-4,10-12 *"
    python scripts/wait_for_round.py --at 2026-09-29T21:30Z

WHY. A capture only counts as the close when it lands strictly before face-off
and no more than `closing_lines.CLOSE_MAX_LEAD` (150 minutes) before it. GitHub
starts this repository's scheduled runs hours late: 3.5-4.2 h measured on
2026-09-24, 5.5-6.0 h on 2026-09-28. A cron written at the round it wants
therefore lands at 7pm ET face-off or after it, and the 23:00 UTC round lands
past midnight in New York, so it captures tomorrow's slate and restores
nothing of today's. Lateness is not stable enough to aim a cron at: it moves
by hours between days, and the close window is 150 minutes wide.

So every cron fires `ROUND_LEAD` before its round, and the run waits here,
before the capture, until the round. Lateness up to `ROUND_LEAD` then costs
nothing; beyond it, the run captures as soon as it starts, which is what
every run did before. A run is never held past its round and never captures
early because it started early.

A job may run for at most six hours, so the wait is split across two jobs,
each waiting at most `--budget-minutes`; the second picks up where the first
stopped, because the round is recomputed from the same cron each time.

The round is the most recent time the cron named, at or before now, plus
`ROUND_LEAD`: a scheduled run always starts after its cron time, and never a
day late. A cron that names specific days (the opening week) is read the same
way; only its minute and hour matter here.

`--at` is for a run started by hand: it waits until that UTC time, which must
be in the future and within `MAX_AT_AHEAD`. No schedule and no `--at` means
no wait. Nothing here fetches, spends a credit or reads a secret.
