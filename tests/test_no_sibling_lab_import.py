"""This lab may not reach into a sibling lab, and nothing was checking.

There are five betting labs in this account — NFL, NCAAF, NHL, EPL and college
basketball — one per sport, and they deliberately share no code. Machinery moves
between them by being **ported**: copied into the repository that uses it, where
it is visible and free to diverge as the sport demands.

That was a promise in a docstring until it was broken. The NCAAF lab's venv was
copied from the NFL lab's to save a few minutes of setup, and that installed
`football_betting_lab` into it as an editable package pointing at the sibling
repository. No line of code had to be written for the two labs to be coupled:
any module could have imported it and it would simply have worked, with no
error and no warning, through a path nobody reads.

Two things are asserted, because either alone is insufficient:

* no module here imports a sibling lab — catches a line someone writes;
* no sibling lab is importable from this environment — catches the environment
  making it possible in the first place.

The second is the one that actually bit. A test that only read source would have
passed all day.
