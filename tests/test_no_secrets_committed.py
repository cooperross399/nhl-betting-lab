"""Repository hygiene: no credential may reach a tracked file.

These tests run against the files git actually tracks, so they fail the build
if a secret is ever committed — including by a future change that means well.
They deliberately do not read `.env`: the point is to prove nothing *else*
contains a credential, and reading the real key here would be the very leak
being guarded against.

Ported from the EPL lab, where this guard has held since the provider was
first wired up. Do not weaken it.
